    <h2>Garage Door Repairs: Quick Fixes for Common Problems</h2>
    <p>Even the best garage doors can run into issues from time to time. Here are some common problems we can fix in no time:</p>

    <h3>1. Broken Springs</h3>
    <p>Garage door springs are under a lot of tension, and they can wear out or break over time. This can make it difficult or even dangerous to open or close your door. Our technicians are trained to safely replace broken springs, so your door is back in action quickly.</p>

    <h3>2. Misaligned Tracks</h3>
    <p>If your garage door isn’t opening or closing smoothly, the tracks might be misaligned. We’ll realign the tracks and ensure everything is running smoothly.</p>

    <h3>3. Noisy Doors</h3>
    <p>A noisy garage door can be annoying and disruptive. Whether it’s squeaking, grinding, or rattling, we’ll identify the cause of the noise and fix it so your door operates quietly and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>4. Damaged Panels</h3>
    <p>Dented or damaged panels not only affect the appearance of your garage door but can also compromise its functionality. We can replace or repair damaged panels to restore your door’s look and performance.</p>

    <h3>5. Faulty Openers</h3>
    <p>If your automatic garage door opener isn’t working properly, it can be a major inconvenience. We’ll diagnose the issue and repair or replace the opener to get your door back on track.</p>
